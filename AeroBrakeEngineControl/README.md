# Aero Control

## Overview:

The **Aero Control** mod for GTA V enhances the realism and control over aircraft by ensuring that the engine remains on when the player applies brakes. It prevents the unintended shutdown of the engine during braking maneuvers, even when holding the ***S*** key or any key bound to braking. This ensures better aircraft control and more immersive gameplay, especially during landings.

## Features:

- **Engine Control During Braking:** Ensures that when the player applies the brakes (by holding S or any other control bound to braking), the aircraft engine remains on, providing continuous power during braking.
- **Smoke Effect on Landing:** Smoke effects are generated on the plane's wheels when the aircraft is landing.
- **Automatic Detection:** Detects if the player is flying a plane and applies the appropriate control logic.
- **Smooth Realistic Experience:** No interruptions in gameplay. The mod ensures fluid transitions during braking and landing operations.
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays notifications indicating the activation of special modes like "Runway Taxi Mode."
