# British Belisha Beacons & School Sign

## Overview

This mod enhances the **Belisha Beacons** and **School Signs** in GTA V by adding realistic lighting effects, eliminating the need for a script. After extensive testing, we found that adding lights directly to the props creates a more reliable and visually appealing result than using a scripted solution.

## Important:

Before proceeding with the installation, **please back up your original game files**. This will allow you to easily revert to your previous setup in case anything goes wrong. Additionally, we highly recommend using a **mods folder** to avoid corrupting your base game installation.

## Features:

- **Belisha Beacons**: The lights now flash continuously, day and night. For added realism, the brightness is set to:
  - **10% at night**
  - **50% during the day**

- **School Signs**: The lights flash only during peak school hours, from **7-9 a.m.** and **3-5 p.m.**, replicating real-world operation.

## Versions
### V1.0.0
- Initial Release.

### V1.1.0
- Added FiveM resource.
- Added custom ymaps for better prop collisions.
- Adjusted the top section of the Belisha Beacon, now featuring a slightly darker tone for improved contrast.
