# AeroBrake Engine Control

## Overview

The **AeroBrake Engine Control** mod for GTA V ensures that the engine of planes remains on when the player applies the brakes, even when holding the ***S*** key. This mod enhances the realism and control over aircraft, preventing the unintended shutdown of the engine during braking maneuvers.

## Features:

- **Engine Control During Braking:** Ensures that when the player applies the brakes (by holding S or any other control bound to braking), the aircraft engine remains on, providing continuous power during braking.
- **Seamless Integration:** Automatically detects if the player is flying a plane and applies the control logic without any manual intervention.
- **Smooth and Realistic:** No interruption to gameplay or aircraft functionality. The engine stays on even when stopping or slowing down the plane.
