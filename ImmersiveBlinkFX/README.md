# üëÄ Immersive Blink FX - V1.3.0 üëÄ

## üôéüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Overview

This script adds subtle visual effects to your screen in Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) that mimic the blinking effect seen when closing and opening your eyes. This enhances immersion and creates a more natural experience when playing..

## üöÄ Features

- **Realistic Blinking:** The script simulates blinking when in first-person view, enhancing the immersion.
- **Configurable Durations:** Customize how long the screen fades out and fades back in during a blink.
- **Randomized Blinking:** Enable or disable random blink intervals to simulate more natural eye behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements (Singleplayer)
- **ScriptHookV:** [Download ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)
- **ScriptHookVDotNet-nightly:** [Download ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet-nightly/releases/latest)

## üîß Installation (Singleplayer)
1. Copy the `ImmersiveBlinkFX.dll` file to your GTA V `scripts` folder.
2. Configure blink settings via the `scripts\\Code-Master\\Configs\\ImmersiveBlinkFX.ini` file.
3. Done! The script will activate automatically in-game.

## üîß Installation (FiveM)
1. Copy the entire `ImmersiveBlinkFX` folder to your server‚Äôs `resources` directory.
2. Add `ensure ImmersiveBlinkFX` or `start ImmersiveBlinkFX` to your `server.cfg`.
3. Configure blink settings via the `config.lua` file.
4. Done! The script is now live on your FiveM server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### FiveM 
Inside `config.lua`, you can modify the following settings:
```lua
config = {
    BlinkDurationIn = 150,    -- Duration for fade out (in milliseconds)
    BlinkDurationOut = 150,   -- Duration for fade in (in milliseconds)
    BlinkInterval = 10000,    -- Default time between blinks (in milliseconds)
    EnableRandomBlinks = false, -- Enable or disable random blink intervals
    RandomBlinkMin = 1000,    -- Minimum random blink interval (in milliseconds)
    RandomBlinkMax = 5000,    -- Maximum random blink interval (in milliseconds)
}
```

### Singleplayer
Inside `ImmersiveBlinkFX.ini`, you can modify the following settings:
```ini
[IBFX_SETTINGS]

; Fade-out duration (entering black screen)
BlinkDurationIn = 150

; Fade-in duration (exiting black screen)
BlinkDurationOut = 150

; Time between blinks in milliseconds
BlinkInterval = 10000

[IBFX_RANDOM_BLINKS]

; Enable random blinks
EnableRandomBlinks = false

; Range for random blink interval MIN
RandomBlinkMin = 1000

; Range for random blink interval MAX
RandomBlinkMax = 10000

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
Once installed, the blink effect will automatically activate during gameplay in first person camera ONLY.

## üìã Changelog

> #### ‚úîÔ∏è V1.3.0 | Enhancements & Bug Fixes
```diff
+ Customizable Random Blinks: Introduced a configurable boolean setting in the INI file to toggle the 'EnableRandomBlinks' feature, allowing users to customize the interval between blinks. This feature generates a random duration within the range defined by RandomBlinkMin (in milliseconds) and RandomBlinkMax (up to 10,000 milliseconds).

+ Removed redundant code: Streamlined the codebase by removing redundant segments, addressing minor stuttering issues encountered during gameplay.

+ FiveM Version: The FiveM version has been completely rewritten in LUA, enhancing clarity and reliability. Initially crafted in C#, the script transitioned to LUA due to persistent errors and a stronger familiarity with the latter language.

- NOTE: If updating to V1.2.0 we recommend deleting previous version files.

+ Periphery-to-Center Effect: I've added a new periphery-to-center effect when blinking, which simulates the screen going black from the edges towards the center during the blink.

+ Renamed DLL FiveM: Renamed FiveM dll from ImmersiveBlinkFX.net.dll to ImmersiveBlinkFX.Client.dll.
```
