# 🙎🏼‍♀️ Overview

The <span style="color:darkorange; text-shadow: 0 0 20px black; font-size: 15px;">**Slash'N'Dash**</span> script is a GTA V mod that adds dynamic gameplay by allowing players to slash vehicle tyres using melee weapons. It features adjustable detection distances for vehicles, tyres, and police, as well as a configurable key for triggering the tyre slashing action. The script also includes a police alert system, where the player’s wanted level is increased if police are nearby. Additionally, the script supports a customizable config file for personalized settings, providing an immersive and customizable gameplay experience.
